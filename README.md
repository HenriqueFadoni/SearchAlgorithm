# Search Algorithm

In this Web Application, you will observe practical models of Linear and Binary Search Algorithm. Additionally, you can interact with the examples to better comprehend how these algorithms work behind the scenes. 

Nevertheless, you are going to be exposed to common types of datasets. For instance: non-organized collections, sorted data, and self-organized arrays. Therefore, you will also learn how you can optimize a Search Algorithm.

## What did I learn?

Through this project, I was challenged by myself. I did not only learn how to ''slow down'' an algorithm and turn it into a visual software. But, I also have learned in-depth on how to optimize and employ different Search Algorithms. It was remarkably fun and challenging to build such an application.
